# ToDoList
A todo list i made to pass the time, with contributions. 

***Rylan-B fixed the spagetti thank you so muchhhh***

3-0 is the latest, 2-0 is left because it's so radically different, and you NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTPUT. I ran my code in geany and it did not work because i could not see the output (or rather, it did i just wasn't able to use it)

uh good luck its spegetti code, works fine. 

4-0 is coming soon im learning how to use tkinter to make GUI for the app so thats _fun_
